# Classification-Project
Unsupervised vs supervised classification project on vertebral column data

kNN vs k-means clustering for classifying vetebral column data into 'abnormal' or 'normal' groups
kNN much more successful, in hindsight k-means was probably not the best unsupervised choice for this project, may revisit using transformation techniques such as PCA or other unsupervised methods, pleased with kNN performnace.
